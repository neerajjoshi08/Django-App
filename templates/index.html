            <h5>Nature</h5>
            <p>Nature, in the broadest sense, is the natural, physical, material world or universe. "Nature" can refer
              to the phenomena of the physical world, and also to life in general. The study of nature is a large, if
              not the only, part of science. Although humans are part of nature, human activity is often understood as a
              separate category from other natural phenomena.</p>

            <h5>Rivers</h5>
            <p>A river is a natural flowing watercourse, usually freshwater, flowing towards an ocean, sea, lake or
              another river. In some cases, a river flows into the ground and becomes dry at the end of its course
              without reaching another body of water. Small rivers can be referred to using names such as stream, creek,
              brook, rivulet, and rill. There are no official definitions for the generic term river as applied to
              geographic features, although in some countries or communities a stream is defined by its size. Many names
              for small rivers are specific to geographic location; examples are "run" in some parts of the United
              States, "burn" in Scotland and northeast England, and "beck" in northern England. Sometimes a river is
              defined as being larger than a creek,but not always: the language is vague.</p>

            <h5>Mountains</h5>
            <p>A mountain is an elevated portion of the Earth's crust, generally with steep sides that show significant
              exposed bedrock. A mountain differs from a plateau in having a limited summit area, and is larger than a
              hill, typically rising at least 300 metres (1000 feet) above the surrounding land. A few mountains are
              isolated summits, but most occur in mountain ranges.
              Mountains are formed through tectonic forces, erosion, or volcanism, which act on time scales of up to
              tens of millions of years. Once mountain building ceases, mountains are slowly leveled through the action
              of weathering, through slumping and other forms of mass wasting, and through erosion by rivers and
              glaciers.</p>
